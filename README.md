# Awesome MCP Security [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of security tools, frameworks, scanners, gateways, and resources for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how AI agents connect to external tools and data sources. As adoption grows, so does the attack surface. This list tracks the ecosystem of projects working to make MCP safer.
